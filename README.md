# DATA211A1
Repository for DATA 211 Assignment 1, completed February 2019 

This was some time ago for me and was also my (and many other business students alike) introduction to coding in general. Overall, this was an assignment to get myself familiarized with not only coding, but Python as well. As a result, the assignment is extremely simple and not really meant to highlight any skills.
